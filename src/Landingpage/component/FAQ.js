                    <br />
                    1. No mains electricity is available <br />
                    2.There is insufficient power from the mains supply to meet
                    requirements <br />
                    3.To protect against the possibility of periodic or
                    sustained loss of mains power, which can cause such things
                    as economic loss, loss of power, loss of lighting, loss of
                    life support equipment, loss of production, loss of data
                    storage and loss of products, livestock or even human life.

                 1. Canara Electrical Engineer offers generator sets to provide prime power, standby power and rental power. We produce diesel and gas-powered units from as small as 5 kVA that are ideal for domestic and small retail properties up to sets as large as 625 kVA that can provide power for a large building with several offices. Our generators can be started either manually or automatically and can be provided either as integral sets or cap-on sets.

                  There is no precise answer to this question. 
                  The size of generator set required will depend on a number 
                  of individual factors. To ensure that your generator set is 
                  correctly sized, you should contact your local Canara Electrical Engineer Dealer. They will make an appointment to come out and help you identify the power rating for all the equipment and appliances on your premises, enabling them to provide you with details of the exact size and type of generator that is best suited for your needs.

                    <strong>The following all need to be considered when you are thinking of installing a generator set:</strong>  <br />
                    

        <strong>Location</strong> <br />
1. you will need to think of where you want to place the generator set – ideally it should be located in a place with adequate access and lighting for service and maintenance purposes. Generators can be located inside or outside your premises – Canara Electrical Engineer offer Sound Attenuated Canopies when generators are to be located outside.
<br />
<strong> Mounting</strong>  <br />

1. generator sets should be mounted on a level base and use anti-vibration mounts when necessary. Most level surfaces are suitable, if installing a set on soil or a roof you should consult a civil engineer.
 
 <br />

 <strong>Ventilation and Cooling</strong> <br />
1. it is important to make sure that there is enough ventilation to help keep the generator cool and to remove excess fumes and heat produced through engine combustion.
 <br />
 <strong>Fuel System</strong> <br />
1. you will need to consider how you will refuel your generator. Several refueling options are available from manual pumps to fully automatic systems. Smaller sets usually have a manually operated mechanical or electrical operated pump, which can refill the set’s base tank from a fuel drum.

                  There is no set answer to this question. Canara Electrical Engineer generators are designed to last for long periods of time and function in heavy duty operations. However, it is important that the set is inspected regularly between each use, before restarting to check such things as fuel and oil levels and any signs of abnormalities. Our sets can run continuously when the amount of load is lowered.

                  Constant mains electricity is supplied into premises via electrical cabling. When this mains electricity is disrupted due to power failures, a signal is sent from the transfer switch to the generating set which then starts up and sends generated electricity back into the premises. When the mains supply is restored the transfer switch blocks the power from the generating set and reverts back to the main supply

                  Canara Electrical Engineer manufactures both open sets and canopied sets – if your generator is being installed outdoors, we would recommend that you buy a canopied set. This means that you would not need to build an enclosure around it. Generator sets require an air supply that can circulate to cool such components as the engine. There needs to be a continuous circulation of air when the generator is functioning and this may be unlikely in a home built enclosure. Canara Electrical Engineer canopied sets include proper air cooling systems with louvres that let air circulate around the various components. Poorly-designed enclosures can lead to excessive air relocation, which means that dust or moisture from rain is drawn into the enclosure causing premature failure

                  Canara Electrical Engineer generator sets are designed to function in hostile environments and during extreme weather conditions. To extend the life of a generator and to prevent such things as shorting and rusting, if possible they should be protected from the elements.

                  The frequency and type of service required to maintain a Canara Electrical Engineer generator set will depend on a number of things including the usage of the generator, the environment that it operates in and the percentage load that it carries. Ensuring that a full service is carried out regularly is the responsibility of you as the owner. You will need to carry out frequent visual inspections every two to three months to check that things are functioning – any faults or repairs that you note should be passed on to your local Canara Electrical Engineer dealer. A full service including a change of such things as filters and lubricating oil should be carried out every twelve months. Most failures to start-up are the result of the set not having been regularly tested. We recommend that you check your generator once a week.
